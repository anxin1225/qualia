INSTRUCTIONS TO BUILD THE DISTRIBUTION ON UNIX
==============================================

To build BEAGLE Puppy on Unix, uncompress the distribution, open a shell,
'cd' to the uncompressed distribution main directory, and type the
following commands.

      ./configure
      make clean
      make

This will configure and compile the libraries composing the framework.
Optionally, you can install the framework by typing the following command.

      make install

By default, the compiled libraries are installed in folder
'/usr/local/lib', while the headers are installed in folder
'/usr/local/include'. You can specify the installation folder by
giving the option '--prefix=PATH' to the 'configure' script.

'configure' recognizes the following options to control how it operates.

'--prefix=PATH'
     Set the main installation folder (default: '/usr/local').

'--disable-shared'
     Disable the build of the shared framework libraries.

'--disable-static'
     Disable the build of the static framework libraries.
     
'--cache-file=FILE'
     Use and save the test results in file FILE instead of
     './config.cache'.  Set FILE to '/dev/null' to disable caching, for
     debugging 'configure'.

'--help'
     Print a summary of the options to 'configure', and exit.

'--quiet'
'--silent'
'-q'
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
     suppress all normal output, redirect it to '/dev/null' (any error
     messages will still be shown).

'--version'
     Print the version of autoconf used to generate the 'configure'
     script, and exit.

'configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.


INSTRUCTIONS TO BUILD THE DISTRIBUTION ON MS VISUAL C++ .NET 2003
=================================================================

Open the solution file 'puppy.sln' in folder 'MSVCPP', then compile
either a debug or a release version of the library and the
examples provided.
