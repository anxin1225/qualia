This project is realized with the support of CINQ as part of the Emerge research project with 
LabXmodal (Concordia Univeristy, Montreal), IDMIL (McGill University, Montreal) and 
Moment Factory (Montreal).

Objectives
----------

1. Allow to easily switch between different environments
 * Two modes: simulation (computer) vs embedded (AVR).
 * The agent should stay the same.
 * Interchangeable environment simulation vs embedded
 * Easy switch between the two modes

2. Well-managed on AVR chips
 * Low memory trace (Flash and SRAM)
 * Static allocation

3. Modular
 * Agent can stay the same while environments are exchanged
 * eg. easy switch of reward function (reinforcement learning)

4. Multi-paradigm
 * Procedural
 * FSM
 * Reinforcement learning

Compiling
---------

Standard build (eg. on i386 platforms):
$ scons

Build for AVR:
$ scons --avr

Build for Arduino:
$ scons --arduino

Cleaning up (example):
$ scons --avr --clean

To compile examples, go to the example folder and run scons. The qualia library needs to be compiled first.

Installing
----------
 
See INSTALL file for installation procedure on standard (PC) platform.
