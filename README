Objectives
----------

1. Allow to easily switch between different environments
 * Two modes: simulation (computer) vs embedded (AVR).
 * The agent should stay the same.
 * Interchangeable environment simulation vs embedded
 * Easy switch between the two modes

2. Well-managed on AVR chips
 * Low memory trace (Flash and SRAM)
 * Static allocation

3. Modular
 * Agent can stay the same while environments are exchanged
 * eg. easy switch of reward function (reinforcement learning)

4. Multi-paradigm
 * Procedural
 * FSM
 * Reinforcement learning
