 * Observation.h
 *
 * Represent observations returned by the environment to the agents. Observations in Qualia
 * are continuous. A specific observation is represented by a multi-dimensional array of real
 * numbers. Notice that discrete observation components can be represented as well since the
 * underlying data is an array of real numbers, so you can put integers in there as long as
 * you know what you're doing.
